## WP Post Carousel Plugin for Gutenberg

Uses [Owl Carousel](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/) and WP API to help you setup a dynamic post carousel using the Gutenberg block builder, slated for release in WordPress 5.x.

Currently supports all public post types. 

More work to come on formatting and special integrations for [Stirling Technologies](https://stboston.com/) custom WordPress plugins for our enterprise clients.

**Note: This plugin requires the [Gutenberg feature plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) to run until Gutenberg is merged into Core.**

Pull requests welcome.
